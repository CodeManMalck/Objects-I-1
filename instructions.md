Write a function called `getValue` which takes two parameters:

- `obj` - an object 
- `key` - a string

The function should return the value that is associated with the given key.

**Notes**:

- If the key is not found in the object, it should return undefined.

**For example:**

```
var obj = {
```

```
  'key': 'value'
```

```
};
```

```
var output = getValue(obj, 'key');
```

```
console.log(output); // should print 'value'
```
